                    This case was carried out to assess my skills by the company Looqbox. It is divided into 2 mini-projects:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Project 1</b> - Answering questions: This particular Looqbox customer has several stores that sell retail products such as beverages and bakery items. I was able to connect to the following client's datasets using MySQL:
                    <br><ul>
                    <li>Product information</li>
                    <li>Product Sales Information</li>
                    <li>Store information</li>
                    <li>Store sales information</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    The goal was to answer the following questions:
                    <br><ol>
                    <li>How many products does the company have?</li>
                    <li>What are the 10 most expensive products in the company?</li>
                    <li>What sections of the 'BEVERAGE' and 'BAKERY' departments have?</li>
                    <li>On which day were the most products sold? In which store?</li>
                    <li>What was the total sale of products (in $) of each business area in the first quarter of 2019?</li>
                    </ol><br>
